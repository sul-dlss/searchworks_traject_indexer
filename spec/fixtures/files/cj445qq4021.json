In the first issue of People’s Computer Company, published in 1972, they described the PCC as a “place to play with computers” and to “learn how to use computers.”  The PCC took on the mission of extending access to computers and bring “computers to the people.”  An important part of this mission was the publication of a newsletter/magazine.  Called People’s Computer Company, People’s Computers, or Recreational Computing at various times in its history, the newsletter played an important role in areas such as computer games, computer education, and promotion of the BASIC programming language.","type":"abstract","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]}],"identifier":[],"subject":[{"structuredValue":[{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"Computer industry","type":"topic","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]},{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"United States","type":"place","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]},{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"History","type":"topic","identifier":[],"note":[],"appliesTo":[]}],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"uri":"http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh2008101488","identifier":[],"source":{"code":"lcsh","note":[]},"note":[],"appliesTo":[]},{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"Microelectronics industry","type":"topic","uri":"http://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects/sh85084825","identifier":[],"source":{"code":"lcsh","note":[]},"note":[],"appliesTo":[]},{"structuredValue":[],"parallelValue":[],"groupedValue":[],"value":"People's Computer Company","type":"organization","uri":"http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n77008526","identifier":[],"source":{"code":"naf","note":[]},"note":[],"appliesTo":[]}],"relatedResource":[],"marcEncodedData":[],"purl":"https://purl.stanford.edu/cj445qq4021"},"identification":{"catalogLinks":[]},"created":"2022-04-27T03:15:35.000+00:00","modified":"2024-06-13T09:37:28.000+00:00","lock":"druid:cj445qq4021=0=1"}
